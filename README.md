# üìö Data Analysis of Amazon Top-Selling Books  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **Amazon‚Äôs Top-Selling Books** dataset using multiple data analytics tools and machine learning models.  
The aim was to uncover **reading trends, genre popularity, pricing strategies, and customer preferences**, while also testing predictive models for classification tasks.  

## üéØ Objectives  
- Analyze sales distribution across genres, authors, and pricing.  
- Study correlations between **ratings, reviews, and sales performance**.  
- Build interactive dashboards using **Power BI, Tableau, and Excel**.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Python.  
- Train and compare multiple **machine learning classification models**.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- **Excel** ‚Üí Pivot tables, slicers, interactive charts.  
- **Power BI** ‚Üí Interactive dashboards for sales trends, price vs. sales, and genre popularity.  
- **Tableau** ‚Üí Visual storytelling with advanced charts and filters.  
- **Python** ‚Üí Data preprocessing, visualization, and model training.  
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `scikit-learn`  

## üìä Data Analysis & Visualizations  
### Excel Dashboard  
- Sales overview by **genre, author, and year**.  
- Ratings vs. reviews correlation.  
- Genre split (Fiction vs Non-Fiction).  

### Power BI Dashboard  
- Sales performance by **price range and genre**.  
- Top-performing **authors and books**.  
- Price vs. sales insights.  

### Tableau Dashboard  
- Top 10 authors & books (bar charts, treemaps).  
- Ratings distribution & customer sentiment.  
- Genre popularity analysis.  

### Python EDA  
- **Scatterplots**: Price vs. Ratings, Reviews vs. Ratings.  
- **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix.  
- **Pairplot & Histograms**: Distribution patterns.  
- **Boxplots & Violinplots**: Price and rating distributions.  
- **Countplots**: Books per genre/author.  

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models  
Trained multiple models on preprocessed data:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

### üìà Model Performance  
| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 71.42%   | 68.98%    | 78.12% | 72.98%   |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes    | 65.45%   | 66.45%    | 78.12% | 67.11%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 71.81%   | 77.09%    | 73.43% | 75.20%   |
| Support Vector Machine  | **74.87%**   | **79.45%**    | 74.43% | **76.38%**   |

‚û°Ô∏è **SVM performed the best** with the highest accuracy and F1 score.  

## ‚úÖ Conclusion  
- **Dashboards** provided clear insights into Amazon book sales trends.  
- **Python visualizations** revealed key correlations and distributions.  
- **Machine learning models** successfully classified sales-related patterns, with SVM achieving the best results.  
- This framework can be extended to other **e-commerce datasets** for strategic decision-making.
